# Gambit-ThreeHouses-Style-AOE-Attack

## How 2 Compile

Just put Event Assembler and FE8U rom named "FE8_clean.gba", then click ```MAKE HACK.cmd```.

AOE core is at EngineHacls/Gambit, which is among a lot of CoreSupports, just like UnitMenu remake, Action Rework, etc.

Besides, you can set more effect range by putting other functions on top of ```GambitEffectMap_DrawMapRoutineTable```, which is defined at ```EngineHacks\Gambit\GambitEffectMap\GambitEffectMap.event ```
